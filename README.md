In the context of the C# module of our school, we had to develop a WPF application in teams of two.

Our project is a turn-based video game against an AI inspired by the Chainsaw Man anime.

You play as the main character from the anime, Denji, and face off against one of the villains in this universe, Katana Man, also known as Samurai Sword.

You start the game with 200 HP, 200 blood points, and $0. Blood points function like mana; attacks consume blood, and defeating a monster replenishes it.

Initially, you only have Denji's basic attack, Chainsaw Slash, which doesn't consume blood and deals 30 damage to the opponent.

You have access to a shop offering various attacks, a healing spell to restore HP, a blood booster to replenish blood, and a Totem Booster named Pochita, which boosts your damage by 15%.

You can only purchase these items if you have enough money.

Whenever your opponent dies, they respawn with more life, more blood, and new attacks based on their level.

If you try to buy a new attack from the shop when you already have four equipped (the maximum number), a popup appears, allowing you to either replace one of your equipped attacks or simply put the new attack into your inventory.

In-game, you can access your inventory by clicking on the backpack icon at the bottom left of the screen, allowing you to swap an attack from your inventory with one that's already equipped by clicking on the latter.

The game ends when you die.

Good luck!
And don't forget to turn on the sound on your computer :D
